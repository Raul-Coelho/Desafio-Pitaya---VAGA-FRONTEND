# Technologies used

  - [Angular 8]
  - [MDB Angular] (Bootstrap 4, Material Design, Material Icons)






### Installation

Install dependencies within the project page

```sh
$ cd PROJECT PAGE
$ npm install
```

Right after installing npm packages

### Execution
```sh
$ cd INSIDE PROJECT PAGE
$ ng serve
```
### Browser Access

In the browser will be accessed the following URL

```sh
http://localhost:4200/
```

### Route Style (HTML 5 / # HASH)
In this project we used the URL format / # / because here I don't work with backend connection directly, the HASH format is a way to navigate from page to page. The advantage of this is that it does not require a page refresh.

```sh
http://localhost:4200/#/
```
